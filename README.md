# "Developing Applications for Cloud Foundry / Bluemix" presentation by Tim Crowley on February 24th, 2016 at SSEUG meeting.

A presentation on how Docker may revolutionize the way we develop and deploy software

# Abstract
Many of the current cloud offerings focus on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). And while there are many advantages to this approach, it places the onus on the customer to maintain things like the operating system, and various pieces of middleware. A Platform as a Service (PaaS) abstracts these responsibilities away from the developer, and defers them to the cloud provider.

Cloud Foundry is an open source platform which can be used as a basis for a PaaS solution. Multiple cloud providers leverage Cloud Foundry; one such provider is IBM and their Bluemix offering.

Tim will be describing the basics of the Cloud Foundry platform, and demonstrate how to develop, deploy, and monitor applications within Bluemix.
